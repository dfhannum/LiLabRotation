# Introduction

Here I plan on starting from the first steps of analysis and including all the numbers that would be necessary for the paper. I also plan on including the write-up throughout the document as well.

```{r print R session, include = T}
sessionInfo()
```

```{r loading data from 10X}
wbm.data <- Read10X(data.dir = './data/raw_feature_bc_matrix/')

# Creating Seurat Object

wbm <- CreateSeuratObject(counts = wbm.data, project = 'Mpl', min.cells = 3, min.features = 200)

# Reading in the HTO labels provided by Dr. Brian Parkin

htos <- read.csv('./data/HTOs.csv')

dim(htos)

# Removing all the cells without a label

htos <- htos[htos$HTOs != '',]

dim(htos)

# Adding the conditioni from the HTO tagged, from an e-mail from Priya

htos$condition <- ifelse(htos$HTOs == 'HTO-1', 'Mpl',
                         ifelse(htos$HTOs == 'HTO-2', 'enrMpl',
                                ifelse(htos$HTOs == 'HTO-3', 'Migr1','enrMigr1')))

# Subsetting the two data frames so they only include cells that overlap

wbm <- wbm[,colnames(wbm) %in% htos$Barcode]

htos <- htos[htos$Barcode %in% colnames(wbm),]

# Making sure the cell order is maintained between the two dataframes, so I can
# just add the condition to the meta data

summary(rownames(wbm@meta.data) == htos$Barcode)

# Adding the condition to the meta data

wbm@meta.data$Condition <- htos$condition

```

We started out with **11,278** cells in the experiment. After a basic filtering when creating the Seurat object (minimum of 200 features, also filtered for genes that were expressed in a minimum of 3 cells) we had **10,697** cells. There were only **7,542** cells that had an HTO label, of which **7,228** passed the basic Seurat filtering.

```{r setting cutoffs for cell inclusion}
# Adding a variable for percentage of features coming from mitochondrial genes

wbm[['percent.mt']] <- PercentageFeatureSet(wbm, pattern = '^mt')

ggplot(data = wbm@meta.data, aes(x = nCount_RNA)) + geom_density() +
        geom_vline(xintercept = 50000, col = 'red', linetype = 2) +
        theme_bw()

ggplot(data = wbm@meta.data, aes(x = nFeature_RNA)) + geom_density() +
        geom_vline(xintercept = c(500,5000), col = 'red', linetype = 2) +
        theme_bw()

ggplot(data = wbm@meta.data, aes(x = percent.mt)) + geom_density() +
        geom_vline(xintercept = 10, col = 'red', linetype = 2) +
        theme_bw()

summary(wbm[['nCount_RNA']] < 50000)
summary(wbm[['nFeature_RNA']] > 500 & wbm[['nFeature_RNA']] < 5000)
summary(wbm[['percent.mt']] > 10)

nCount_RNA.passed.cells <- colnames(wbm[,wbm[['nCount_RNA']] < 50000])
nFeature_RNA.passed.cells <- colnames(wbm[,wbm[['nFeature_RNA']] < 5000 & wbm[['nFeature_RNA']] > 500])
mt.percent.passed.cells <- colnames(wbm[,wbm[['percent.mt']] < 10])

venn.diagram(x = list(nCount_RNA.passed.cells, nFeature_RNA.passed.cells, mt.percent.passed.cells),
             category.names = c('nCount_RNA','nFeature_RNA','percent.mt'),
             filename = '#VennDiagramPlot_for_filtering.png', output = T)

wbm <- subset(wbm, subset = nFeature_RNA > 500 & nFeature_RNA < 5000 &
                    percent.mt < 10 & nCount_RNA < 50000)
dim(wbm)
``` 

Dashed lines indicate cutoffs I used for subsetting the Seurat dataset.

We end up with **6,121** cells in the experiment.

```{r data manipulation steps, message=F}

# Normalizing the data

all.genes <- rownames(wbm)

# Scaling the data

# Run principal component analysis
wbm <- RunPCA(wbm, features = VariableFeatures(wbm), verbose = F)

wbm <- RunUMAP(wbm, dims = 1:15)
